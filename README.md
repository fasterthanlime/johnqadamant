### Story

1824 - the 10th US presidential election. Even though he doesn't have either the popular or the electoral majority, John Quincy Adams is elected President of the United States. 

The ten losing candidates (the "Ten Seconds") devise a plan to take revenge - they shall mount an army the likes of which no one has ever seen, and destro John Q. and everything he stands for. 

However, their plan took a little longer than expected, and it is now 2013. The Ten, along with John Q., are still alive, thanks to the elixir of youth, discovered accidentally and now for sale in supermarkets. 

Play as one of the ten seconds - each with different ships, backstories, and weapons, and blast your way through victory!
