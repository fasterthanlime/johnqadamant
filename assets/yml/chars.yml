      description: >
          This little rascal was not only Speaker of the House for two years,
          he was also President of the Second Bank of the United States founded
          by his friend John Marshall.

    - name: John Marshall
      ship: [2, 0]
      description: >
          John Marshall was the longest serving Chief Justice of the US. That
          guy was basically the law. One of his decisions was to create the
          Second Bank of the United States. He eventually declined to run
          inn 1824 - but my guess is that he would have loved to have his
          very own presidential coin.

      description: >
          John Randolph was a Congressman and plantation owner from Virginia.
          He also served as Minister to Russia, hence his red ship to the colors
          of the Motherland. He has been retired from quite some time - but
          he has kept good relations with former sovietic friends.

      description: >
          Clinton was a United States Senator who also happened to be the Sixth
          Governor of New York. He was a member of the Erie Canal commission and
          quickly became the driving force behind its construction. His ship
          is made of solidified water, which only he knows about.

    - name: Nathanial Macon
      ship: [0, 1]
      description: >
          Macon hated war. And when you see the money and interests that defense
          contractors have spawned, who can blame him? However, before he tried
          to shoot down the navy, he was a successful tobacco planter. In fact,
          he like tobacco so much, his ship is fueled on cigars!

      description: >

          Supreme Court. But his true passion was revealed to him when he was
          Secretary of the Navy: boats! In 2013, he has perfected the airboat, and
          it's his weapon of choice to attack The Adamant.
